<h3>Toolkit Overview</h3>
<div class="helptext">
The ARES Toolkit is your emergency event project management buddy. By using the Toolkit, you will see better time management, and better money management.
</div>

<a name="startstop"></a>
<br />
<h3>Starting & Stopping the Toolkit</h3>
<div class="helptext">
When the USB stick is inserted into any available USB port in your computer, it will be ready to run.
<br /><br /><b>For Macintosh users</b>, simply double-click on the new "TOOLKIT" icon on your Desktop to open the Toolkit, then double-click the icon labeled "Macintosh Start".
<br /><br /><b>For Windows users</b>, when the drive is inserted, you should be prompted to run the program. If the prompt does not appear, then use your My Computer or Windows Explorer programs to click on the new "TOOLKIT" icon, then double-click the icon labeled "Windows Start".
<br /><br />As long as the USB stick remains in the computer, you may use the appropriate "..Start" icons to re-start the Toolkit.
<br /><br /><b>To shut down the Toolkit</b>, click the link in the Menu of the Toolkit, then quit out of the Toolkit window completely once you receive the "..Toolkit Has Stopped.." notice. If you have already closed the Toolkit window, open the "TOOLKIT" and double-click the appropriate "..Stop" icon to stop the Toolkit.
<br /><br />If you are having trouble ejecting the USB stick or re-starting the Toolkit, be sure you have quit completely out of the Toolkit program window and then double-click the appropriate "..Stop" icon in the "TOOLKIT". If the Toolkit program window is still running, then a new one cannot open, and the Mac won't let you eject the stick when some parts of the Toolkit are still running in the background.

<h3>Calendar Overview</h3>
<div class="helptext">
The Calendar is your tool to keep you on time and your project on track, and to help you coordinate with the professionals who you choose to work with. You can see at a glance when activity will occur, and who is responsible for doing what, when. There are three different ways of looking at your Calendared items, each designed to give you valuable information that a single view simply cannot.
<br /><br />To switch between the different views, click on the icons up next to the "Create a New Calendar Item" button.
<br /><br />Tasks assigned to the Homeowner are highlighted in blue, and tasks which are the responsibility of the Contractors are highlighted in red.

<h3>Budget Manager Overview</h3>
<div class="helptext">
The Budget Manager will help you keep an eye on your money.
